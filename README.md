# Pythagorean triples algorithm in Ruby

Run `./run.rb` script to generate a data.dat file with the triples.

If LIMIT environment variable is defined it will generate only the points in a LIMITxLIMIT square. If not it will try to find all triples (running infinitely).

Use `gnuplot -c plot` to generate a "graph.png" image with x,y points
